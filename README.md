-         I have been working for the Remote Sensing and GIS Division, Department of Geological Research,
        Directorate, General of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) in Turkey more than 2 and half years. I am working as
        a Remote Sensing Expert and focusing on surface deformation, geological phenomena related to mining activities,
        earthquake research and modeling, tectonic analysis, geohazard detection and monitoring (for dams) by using
        EnviSarScape and SNAP software with ArcGIS. I am using Python (GDAL, Rasterio, Numpy, Matplotlib, GeoPandas,
        Scipy, Tkinter) modules to process satellite images, observe temporal changes on images, perform classification, and
        manipulate data.
